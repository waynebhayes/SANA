USAGE="$0 {network.el}
Purpose: use NAUTY's dreadnaut program to enumerate orbits in a graph represented as an edge list.
Since NAUTY insists on node names being integers, we map the network's node names to ints and back.
Output: each line contains exactly one orbit; the line contains all nodes in that orbit.
Thus, the number of columns is equal to the number of nodes in that orbit.
Every node in the network will appear exactly once in the output.
Orbits, and the nodes therein, are listed in no particular order.
(NAUTY is available on Brendan McKay's web page, with an unofficial copy on github.com)"
