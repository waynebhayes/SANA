USAGE="$BASENAME multiAlignTSVFile[s]
PURPOSE: The Multi-Node-Correctness (MNC) of a multiple alignment is Numerator/Denominator, computed as follows:
    Numerator = the sum, over every protein P in the alignment, of the number of equivalent proteins in P's cluster,
	not inclding P itself. So for example if a cluster has 5 proteins, 3 in equivalence class A and 2 in B, then
	each protein in A contributes 2 (total 6), and the two in B each contribute 1 (total 2), giving 8. Note that
	for a given cluster, this is equivalent to the sum, over each equivalent class C with k=|C|, of k*(k-1); in
	our example above, that's 3*2 + 2*1 = 8.
    Denominator = the sum, over every cluster, of the maximum value of the numerator for that cluster; if the cluster
	has k proteins, then the highest possible numerator would be if all k proteins were in the same equivalence class,
	so that each of them gets a score of (k-1), for a total of k*(k-1) (ie., 2*(k choose 2))."
