USAGE="USAGE: $0 [-evc 'egrep-expr' ] [-gene2go (allGO|NOSEQ|...)] [ -GO1freq k ] tax1 tax2 GO1 GO2 G2.el
    where GO1 and GO2 are paths to gene2go files WITHOUT the allGO or NOSEQ extension
Purpose: produce the list of 'predictable-in-principle' (protein,GO) annotations for species tax2: this is simply the
    Cartesian product of
	    {all proteins in G2} x {all (GOterm, EvidenceCode) pairs for tax1 in GO1}.
    By default this Cartesian product is then restricted to include only *validatable* predictions---ie., those that actually
    exist for tax2 in GO2. The result is the largest possible set of 'correct' predictions coming from species1's GO terms in
    the GO1 file, applied to all proteins from species2's G2 network---ie., the size of this set is the denominator of 'Recall'.
    If GO2 is 'NONE', then the Cartesian product is not so restricted. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, because the above Cartesian
    product, unrestricted, is HUGE (bascally |V2| * |GOterms in tax2|).

Options:
    -GO1freq k: remove GO terms with frequencies above k (ie., restrict to GO terms with higher specificity]
    -gene2go XXX: which version of gene2go to use? Options include allGO, NOSEQ, and whatever else exists.
	default=allGO
    -evc 'egrep-expr': restrict predicting evidence codes to those in the egrep-style expression. (NOTE: we don't use
	SEQ_FREE any more since it doesn't make sense in the context of creating a 'predictable-in-principle' set: we
	shouldn't restricted the *predicting* evidence code since it could add value at the target; and we *can't*
	restrict the evidence code at the target because, at this stage, even though it's an annotation predicted in
	the target species, the evidence code is the *PREDICTING* evidence code, not the evidence code we expect at a
	later date---which we cannot possibly predict, nor do we care to.)

NOTE: the evidence code that is output is the SOURCE (ie., predicting) evidence code from species1, and has no bearing
    on the expected evidence code we'll find for species2 in GO2, if annotation is validated. It is produced for
    statistics only, eg., discovering what SOURCE evidence codes provide the best predictions. Typically it's IPI."
