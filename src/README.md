# STYLE GUIDE
by Nil Mamano

Please read before doing a pull request.

## Consistency

- Be consistent with the existing code. Before editing something, take a look around and follow the style used in that file and similar files.
- Since the codebase has a mix of styles, this rule often conflicts with the ones below. You may either conform to the local code, or pay it forward and refactor it.

## Extend, do not modify

- New features should be built in a way such that they *use* the existing code rather than *modify* it as much as possible.
* Especially, try not to modify the core classes like Graph and Alignment. Avoid "polluting" the core classes. Don't add anything to those classes that is specific to a new feature.
Bad example:
Alignment::multiS3Numerator(const Graph& G1, const Graph& G2)
This function is specific to multiS3 measure, so it doesn't belong in the Alignment class.

## Simplicity

- Prefer "functional" methods without side-effects.

- Avoid using new features/libraries/syntax not currently in common use in the code base unless it makes a big difference in readability and/or efficiency. They may be the "correct" choice for a use case, but adding new features may increase the learning time of people maintaining the code in the future.

- Do not shy away from low-level boiler plate code. There are many features that can make the code more concise: optional parameters, overloading function signatures, implicit conversions, default implementations for virtual functions, and so on. However, having to write extra low-level boilerplate code is often better than short code that is clever but harder to understand.

## Write readable code.

- Goal: A first-time reader should be able to follow the code. 

- Avoid very long lines. Try to keep lines to a similar width as the code around them. If a file has mostly short lines and some very long ones, you are welcome to break them down if possible.

- Start function names for functions that return bool with a verb like "is" or "has".
-Name functions that simply return something that is already computed within a class like "getX". Do not name a function "getX" if it does some elaborate computation. 

## Naming conventions

- Use descriptive variable names. The narrower the scope, the shorter the name (e.g., a loop index variable can be named 'i').

- Use camelCase everywhere (file names, function names, variable names, ...) expect for:
* Class names: start with uppercase
* Files containing classes: start with uppercase
* terminal arguments: start with "-" and include only lower case letters (not all follow this currently)

- Use the same variable names across the code base for variables that denote the same thing.
* Variables returned by functions are usually named 'res' (short for 'result').
* Graphs are called G1 and G2, and their sizes are called n1 and n2, and so on. Look up how things are called in existing parts of the code, and follow that.

## Classes / Object-oriented programming (OOP)

- Try to keep the state of classes small. Try to make classes where it is not easy to reach an incoherent state.

- Keep base classes as simple as possible. Avoid adding members to base cases that are only relevant/convenient to a subclass (more on OOP below).

- Prefer composition over inheritance.
Polymorphism and advanced OOP features usually result in brief code, but are harder to maintain and follow. In this trade-off, brevity is not nearly as important as maintainability. Inheritance is already in use in certain parts of the codebase, and may be appropriate in new cases, but keep the trade-off in mind. If you are considering extending the codebase in a way that relies heavily on polymorphism, Google "composition vs inheritance" and read on the discussion around the topic and the alternatives.

## Code duplication

- Do not duplicate code. This should be obvious but has been abused a lot: if you need to adapt a function/class to do something slightly different. Do not simply copy paste it and change a few lines. Factor the common things out into their own function or functions. More than 5 lines that are exactly the same in different places should be a red flag.

## Arbitrary conventions (for consistency)

- Indentation is 4 spaces (not tabs). Set your editor to emit spaces when clicking "tab".
- Preprocessor commands should not be indented (they should touch the left margin). Same with private/public tags in class headers.
- Type "uint" is used instead of int for things that represent sizes or indices (does not make sense to be negative).
- Set/map membership is checked with "count":
if (mySet.count(x)) ...;
instead of "if (mySet.find(x) != mySet.end())" (the two have the same effect).
- Unix-like newlines. If you code locally on Windows, make sure that Git is configured so that newlines are transformed to unix style when pushing to the remote repo. That is a built-in option in Git.
-  In output string streams, endl is used instead of '\n'.
- Use "using namespace std;" at the top of every file, even headers. Do not use "std::". This is, in fact, not a good practice, but it is there for consistency.
- Do not implement one-liner functions in headers. All implementations go in the cpp file, no matter how short.
- Do not write "void" when a function does not take any parameters. Just write "()".

## White space

- Do not overuse vertical whitespace (having to scroll all the time worsens readability).
* One space between functions.
* Use one space within functions to separate parts that do different things.
* Write short single-statement if/while/fors inline.
* White lines at the beginning or end of bracket scopes are not necessary.
* Add comments on the same line when it doesn't violate the line length rule.

- Add a space before and after the parenthesis for the condition of if/while/for statements, but not inside, as in:
if (x > 0) {

- Open bracket goes on the same line as an if/while/for statement.
Closing backet goes on its own line (except for else). Example:
if (...) {
	
} else if (...) {
	
} else {
	
}
Open bracket for a function also goes on the same line as the function name.
In-line bodies are OK for single-statement if's / for's as long as the line length does not exceed its surroundings.

## Comments

- Comments are meant to help the reader, not:
* Enable or disable features
* Store an older version of the code in case you need to roll back (we have Git for that).
* Store a half-finished newer version of the code
If you have a legitimate reason to comment out a block of code, *leave a note indicating its purpose*. Otherwise, 
Do not leave dead code commented out *without* a note indicating why the code. 

- Comments about what a function does or how it is used go in the headers, not the source files. Comments in the source files should be about explaining implementation details.

- Do not leave comments that are hard to understand for a first-time reader. If you do, at least sign it by adding "-Myname" at the end so that people working on the code in the future have someone to reach out to for clarifications.

- When updating code, update associated comments. When moving code around, don't forget associated comments.

## Const-ness

- Specify const-ness wherever applicable, including:
* Class methods that do not modify the class
* Parameters that are not modified (except when passed by value, see above)
* Pointer parameters when the content will not be modified should be passed as const pointers
* Prefer modern C++11 features over older/C-style features. At the same time, do not use features newer than C++11, as the code is compiled with the C++11 standard.

## C features

- Use STL data structures and algorithms when available
* std::string over char*
* std::vector/std::array over C-style arrays

- Use for-each loops over normal for loops for iterating over data structures when the index is not needed.

- Avoid macros and the preprocessor as much as possible. 
* Use constant/constexpr/static variables over macro constants, for instance, to enable/disable sections of code (the compiler knows how to remove dead code, so there is no efficiency gain from the preprocessor removing code explicitly).
* Use functions (even if they need to be global) over macros with arguments
* Use templates over type macros
* Use comment blocks /* */ over #if 0 #endif

## Passing parameters

- By default, pass small parameters (like numbers) by value and large parameters (like vectors) by const reference. Exceptions:
* Short strings should be passed by const reference if they are not modified.
* A parameter that is intended to be modified or used as an additional "return" parameter should be passed by (non-const) reference (but this should be avoided if possible: it is better to return a pair/tuple/struct). 

- Do not use macros to modify the number of parameters of functions.
If some parameters only apply when a specific macro is defined, consider defining a separate function or making those parameters optional by giving them default values.

## Returning values

- By default, return types should be
* By value if the result is something that is computed "on the fly" within the function (even if they are large objects like vectors or strings). In particular, it is not necessary for the caller to initialize the "result" vector in the calling scope and pass it by reference to the callee. 
* By const pointer if the function is a "get" method for a data structure already part of an existing class.
Example:
vector<uint> Graph::getNodesAround(uint node, uint maxDist) const;
//this is something computed on the spot when the function is called, and the Graph class has no interest in storing it, so it should be returned by value.
const vector<string>* Graph::getNodeNames() const;
//a large data structure that is part of the Graph class

## Error handling

- Asserts and errors have different purposes.
* Use asserts within a fuction to validate that the function does what it is intended to do. Asserts should never fire in a bug-free code. Do not use asserts to validate parts of the system you have no control over. E.g., do not use it to validate the input parameters to a function. Asserts are enabled in debug mode but removed for efficiency in the "production" version.
A good hack to add a meaningful message to an assert is to write 
assert(X and "message");
* Throw a runtime_error when something unexpected happens that impedes continuing execution. For example, to signal incorrectly formatted input files and command line arguments, and invalid input values to a public function of a class.
* Keep the exception system minimalistic. Do not use other types of error than runtime_error. Do not catch errors, let them terminate the program. Error-handling logic can add arbitrary amounts of complexity. Simply treat runtime_errors as a way to crash the program with a meaningful message and call stack trace.
* Do not use system exit to terminate the program when there is an error. Use throw runitme_error.

## Scoping

- Declare variables as in the deepest scope where they are used, and as close as possible to their initialization. Initialize them in the declaration when possible. In particular, do not declare them at the beginning of functions as it is done in C.
- Avoid using extern variables as a mechanism to pass variables between files. It is better to explicitly pass the values around as function parameters.
- Do not pollute the global namespace with functions. By default, every function in a class' CPP file should be declared inside the class. Auxiliary functions can be declared static inside the class. When a class is not appropriate, use a namespace.

## Headers

- When a class needs to include a header, avoid duplicating the include in the source and header. Include it in the source file when possible (e.g., if a method takes a vector as an input, then vector needs to be included in the header, but if vectors are only used locally inside the methods' implementations, then vector can go only in the source).
- Use header guards instead of pragma once.

## Efficiency notes

- When filling a long vector, if the size is known before hand:
1) Initialize it empty 2) Reserve the size using .reserve() 3) Fill it using push_back (or emplace_back, if you know the difference and it is more appropriate).
- If the size is not known before hand, you can simply initialize it empty and fill it with push_back.
- It may be more efficient to guess an upper bound on the size, reserve that size with .reserve(), and call .shrink_to_fit() at the end. However, it is not clear if this will be faster, so it should be benchmarked.
- Reserve also works on sets and maps, and it even makes a bigger difference.

- O(n^2) time/space algorithms should be avoided. SANA deals mostly with sparse graphs. That means that O(m) time/space algorithms are much more tractable than O(n^2) ones. 

- Do not use map and set if the ordering of the elements does not matter. Use unordered_map and unordered_set instead. Do not use unordered_map when the key set is the set of indices from 0 to n-1. Use a vector instead. 

## Tech debt

When making changes, pay it forward and reduce technical debt instead of adding to it (Google technical debt).

## Closing remarks

For inspiration, take a loot at the Graph class, which adheres closely to the style guide.

This guide is partly based on the one above by Google, but tailored to the current code base.

# Remaining TODO LIST for SANA 2.0 refactor
1- Move the incremental evaluation logic to each Measure, and use runtime polymorphism to run the appropriate logic for the "active" measures included in MeasureCombination. There is a very nice way to do this incrementally and safely. Start with one measure, say, EC, and add the new logic without removing the existing one. Then, assert at the end of each iteration that the old and new logics coincide. If they do (e.g, across the test suite), the old logic can be safely removed. This can be done measure by measure until SANA is cleaned up. Our other email chain on the subject can serve as basis for the design philosophy to follow to do this.  

2- Insert virtual dummy nodes to handle yin-yang problem in pairwise alignment. Of course, it is always possible to add dummy nodes manually or use multi pairwise with just 2 graphs. The advantage of doing it natively would be efficiency, as it is possibly to not waste time swapping between dummy nodes and still sample neighbor solutions uniformly. However, I don't like that this feature introduces a new concept to the SANA class (virtual dummy nodes) and makes it more complex. For this reason, I wanted to implement (1) before doing this.
