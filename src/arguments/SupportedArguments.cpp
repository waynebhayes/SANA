//This file contains every argument supported by SANA contained basically inside an array, each element in the array contains 6 fields.
//A Description of each field:
// "Option": name of the argument, always begins with a dash.
// "Type": datatype/datastructure that is expected as an argument for that option.
// "Default": IGNORED. Was meant to be the default value if none is given on the command line (why is it ignored ? Instead, defaultArguments array is used) 
// "Title": longer English title (used only by "./sana --help")
// "Description": arbitrarily long description for the option.
// "ExternalAccess": should be "0" or "1". It indicates if this option be accessed from other interfaces controlling SANA (when SANA is NOT run from a shell)
//
// Each line below must start with a "{" and end with "}," (modulo whitespace), since we use a script to convert this to CSV.

// Type rules:
// SANA does not support an "int" native argument type, so integer arguments must be converted either to double or to string. Use type "intD" or "intS" accordingly. 
// arguments that are doubles can also be captured as strings by using type "dblS"
// vector types "string_vec", "dbl_vec", and "int_vec" can be used for sequences of values in the terminal.
// again, there is no native "int_vec" argument type, so it is converted to "dbl_vec" implicitly (should be called intD_vec for consistency)
// the format for vector arguments is an integer followed by exactly that many values (but this is only documented in the description of some of the vector arguments)
// For an exhaustive list of supported types, see the if/else checks inside "validateAndAddArguments" function
