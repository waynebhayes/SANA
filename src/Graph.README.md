# Graph Class Documentation for future developers (written by Nil Mamano)
Graph objects are immutable. Once a graph is constructed, there is no function that allows you to modify its data structures, i.e., every single method is const-qualified and there are no setters*. The reason for this is that the internal data structures interact in non-trivial ways and it'd be hard to keep them consistent.

(* There is one exception where it is possible to reinitialize the color system after the graph has been constructed, but I regret it already so let's pretend that's not an option.)
 
Furthermore, there is a single powerful and flexible constructor, so that is the only tool to use to create/manipulate graphs (besides copy and assignment, which work by default because Graph doesn't use any raw pointers). In particular, there is no default constructor intentionally to disable the option of creating empty graphs and populating the data structures directly.

Here is the constructor:

/* All-purpose constructor
- optionalFilePath can be left empty if not relevant
- self-loops are allowed in the edge list
- the edge list should not contain repeated entries
- if optionalNodeNames is empty, the number of nodes is deduced from
  the edge list and name "i" is given to the i-th node
- if optionalEdgeWeights is empty, all nodes get weight 1 (i.e., unweighted graph).
  Otherwise, edgeWeights should have the same size as edgeList.
  Edges with weight 0 are not supported and will end in runtime_error
- partialNodeColorPairs is a list of node/color name pairs.
  Any node not in any pair gets a special default color */
Graph(const string& name,
      const string& optionalFilePath,
      const vector<array<uint, 2>>& edgeList,
      const vector<string>& optionalNodeNames,
      const vector<EDGE_T>& optionalEdgeWeights,
      const vector<array<string, 2>>& partialNodeColorPairs);

In particular, it is important to know that, even though the edge list is the only mandatory parameter, **nodes always have names and colors, and edges always have weights.** Therefore, getNodeName(), getNodeColor(), and edgeWeight() (should be called getEdgeWeight() to be consistent) will work regardless of how the graph was created.

So, if one needs to read a graph from a file, or construct a derived graph from another, all they need to do is prepare the parameters for the constructor (can be as simple as an edge list) and the constructor will do all the heavy lifting. There are examples of calling the constructor in Graph, in GraphLoader, in CreateShadow, etc. I could have, but didn't, use empty vectors as default values for the last 3 parameters in the constructor. This way, users of the constructor are more aware of all the parameters and the implications of leaving them empty. 

There is a slow (0.2s for yeast) but thorough "isWellDefined" function that validates the internal consistency of the Graph. It used to be at the end of the constructor, but I moved it to the end of initGraphs instead (since initGraphs may call the constructor several times to create derived graphs). Use it any time you manipulate a graph to be sure that a number of guarantees hold: the adjacency matrix is symmetric, the edge list and adjaency list don't have repeated elements, and so on. Without it, the constructor is really fast so it's not a big deal to not have ways to modify graph objects in place.

I'd encourage people to not add new responsibilities to the Graph class, and in fact modify it as little as possible. Instead, add new functionality outside the class, using Graph as a parameter. In particular, all the loading and saving logic is now in GraphLoader. (The logic for that is documented in the source code. Basically, there is a struct for each file format describing the data that can be found in that file. Then there are two steps to load a graph uniformly applied to all file formats: 1. Extract the raw data from the file, without any processing, and put it in the corresponding struct. 2. Process the raw data in the struct to put into the format that the constructor expects, and call the constructor.)

An important detail is that there is a macro EDGE_T defined at compile time which determines the type of the weight of the edges (in particular, in the adjacency matrix). This can be any numeric type. By default, for unweigthed graphs, it's bool, which should be understood as "numeric type of width 1 bit". Most things work out-the-box because of implicit conversion to 0 and 1. Regardless of EDGE_T, an edge is present if and only if the adjacency matrix entry is not 0 (the constructor will complain if there is a 0 in the vector of weights).

Color system is heavily documented on the header. Basically, colors have a "public" name (a string), which can be used to compare if colors from different graphs have the same color, and a "private" id/index, used internally to avoid operating on strings. Don't compare the internal id's of colors in different graphs. There's a function that maps internal ids to internal ids.
