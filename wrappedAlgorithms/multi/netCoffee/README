Description
This file is README file of the package of NetCoffee, developed by Jialu Hu.
To guide you quickly starting to use our alignment tool, we structured this README into four parts:
1) PREREQUISITE
2) COMPILING
3) OPTION
4) EXAMPLE 
Before running this program, you are strongly recommended to read this file carefully.

################################################################################
PREREQUISITE
1. LEMON Graph Library 1.2.3
The source code is freely available under Boost Software License, Version 1.0 at the website: http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/wiki/Downloads
Please first compile the lemon graph library before compiling the code of NetCoffee.
Note that this package should move to the directory $NETCOFFEE/include.
2. FSST package
This package is necessary only if you want to use "-analyse" option to calculate the semantic similarities.
It can be download at http://gotax.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/avail.php.
3. GoTermFinder
This package is necessary only if you want to use "-analyse" option to draw the GoTree View or calculate p-Value of each match-set.
It can be download at http://search.cpan.org/dist/GO-TermFinder/lib/GO/TermFinder.pm.

################################################################################
COMPILING
To compile the source code, the latest compilers which supports the standard language C++11, also known as C++0x, is needed. Other older compiler may not support it.
1. Compile LEMON GRAPH LIBRARY

cd $NETCOFFEE/include/lemon-1.2.3/
./configure
./make

2. Compile NetCoffee

cd $NETCOFFEE
./make MODE=Release
#If you want to compile it in Debug mode, run command:
./make (MODE=Debug)

################################################################################
OPTION
You can see the detailed option information with option "-h".
It is noted that there are two options you must specify if you want to run NetCoffee for an alignment task. They are described as follows:

1. -profile
The default file is "./profile.input", but you can also change the filename and path by "-profile" option.
This file tells the program where to find the dataset and to create output files.
It is expected to be in two-column tab-delimited format.
These lines starting with "#" will be seen as comment.
Each line has one keyword and one value, like this:
$keyword	$value
Using this file, you are allowed to set options (network,gofile,efile,alignmentfile,avefunsimfile,scorefile,logfile) here.
However, you are also allowed to set these option in command line, except for these keywords: network, gofile, efile, which containing multiple files.
Note that, the values must be strictly in order from up to down for keywords "network, gofile, efile".
For example, suppose we have
three PPI networ:1.tab, 2.tab, 3.tab,
go association file: 1.fsst, 2.fsst, 3.fsst,
six balst evalue (or bitscore) files: 1-1.cf, 1-2.cf,...,3-3.cf,
then the profile should looks like:

--------------BEGIN OF PROFILE--------------
#COMMENT $keyword	$value
network  ./dataset/1.tab
network  ./dataset/2.tab
network  ./dataset/3.tab
gofile  ./dataset/goa/1.fsst
gofile  ./dataset/goa/2.fsst
gofile  ./dataset/goa/3.fsst
efile  ./dataset/1-1.cf
efile  ./dataset/1-2.cf
efile  ./dataset/1-3.cf
efile  ./dataset/2-2.cf
efile  ./dataset/2-3.cf
efile  ./dataset/3-3.cf
scorefile     ./dataset/score_composit.model
alignmentfile ./result/alignment_netcoffee.data
avefunsimfile netcoffee_fsst.result
logfile       ./result/measure_time.txt
--------------END OF PROFILE--------------


2. -scorefile
The default file is "./dataset/score_composit.model". This file was empirically obtained from blastp scoring files for othologous model and null model based on e-value.
If the option "bscore" was enabled, this file should be "./dataset/score_composit.bmodel", which calculates the sequence-based score based on bitscore. 
You can run commandline with option "-record -task 0" to generate this data with blastp scoring files.

3. -network
This option specifies the compared PPI networks, which is formated as follows:
--------------BEGIN OF NETWORK--------------
INTERACTOR_A	INTERACTOR_B
Q6QNY1	Q9NWB7
Q96P48	O00220
Q96P48	O14763
O15105	Q92905
Q92905	Q13485
Q16666	Q86WV6
Q9NZH6	P84022
P26717	O43914
P04234	P07766
--------------END OF NETWORK--------------

4. -efile
This option specifies the blastp sequence similarity files for each pair of species, which includes three columns seperated by <TAB>.
The first column provides proteins from the first netwoks, the second column provides proteins from the second networks, the third column provides evalue or bitscore.
However, the options "-bscore" and "-scorefile ./dataset/score_composit.bmodel" must be used if the third column gives bitscore;
The change of protein order in the same line is not allowed.
There are two examples:

--------------BEGIN OF EVALUE FILE--------------
P31946	P62258	1e-116
P31946	Q04917	7e-133
P31946	P61981	2e-135
P31946	P31947	3e-122
P31946	P27348	2e-152
P31946	P63104	4e-162
P62258	P31946	1e-116
P62258	P62258	 0e+00
P62258	Q04917	4e-110
P62258	P61981	3e-112
--------------END OF EVALUE FILE--------------

--------------BEGIN OF BITSCORE FILE--------------
P31946	P62258	  325.0
P31946	Q04917	  367.0
P31946	P61981	  373.0
P31946	P31947	  340.0
P31946	P27348	  416.0
P31946	P63104	  441.0
P62258	P31946	  325.0
P62258	P62258	  524.0
P62258	Q04917	  309.0
P62258	P61981	  315.0
--------------END OF BITSCORE FILE--------------

EXAMPLE
1. Download dataset
Our datasets are freely available at our website: https://code.google.com/p/netcoffee/downloads/list.
Download it into the folder of $NETCOFFEE and uncompress it with command:
tar -zxvf dataset.tar.gz
2. Compile source code
Compile the source code with command:
make MODE=Release
3. Run NetCoffee on our test dataset-2 with command:
./bin/netcoffee -alignment -task 1 -out -alpha ${ALPHA} -numspecies ${num} -numthreads ${thread num} -alignmentfile ./result/alignment_netcoffee.data -resultfolder ./result/
${ALPHA} is the parameter you want to specify for alpha.
Then you can find the all the involved output files in ./result/ .
There are many other functions which you can see with "-help" option.
